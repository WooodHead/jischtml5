# Pre-Meeting #

All of the #jiscHTML5 case studies should come prepared to present their case study as well as work with one another in explaining the case studies and making them as readable and usable for others in the community as possible.  The aim of the event is to have a working draft of the case studies ready for final publications and printing.  The event will also give us a chance to create profiles of each of the authors including pictures, video and interviews of what the authors think of HTML5 and where it is going for use by .AC.UK institutions.

# Abstract #

Following proposed abstract created by Brian Kelly

The JISC has commissioned case studies which cover a range of areas in which HTML5 and related Open Web Platform technologies are being used across the higher education sector to enhance a variety of services.

The "HTML5 Case Studies:  Maximising the Impact" event has been organised to ensure that the case studies have a maximum impact when they are formally launched.

At the event case study authors will be asked to give brief presentations about their work which will highlight the benefits which the developments have provided, the approaches taken in the development work, examples of benefits which may have been identified, challenges which have been overcome and areas in which further
development work would be beneficial.

We will record these presentations and make the recordings available to the speakers. If speakers give their permission, we may subsequently make use of these recordings.

Once the presentations have been given and we have a shared understanding of the work which has been described in the case studies we will then carry out a peer-reviewing exercise in which small groups of authors will collaborate in providing feedback on their case studies.

In the final exercise of the day the participants will help to identify ways in which the case studies can be launched to maximise the value of the case studies.
